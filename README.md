# Music Dive

## Purpose 
This is our first group project in the course. The purpose of this project is for the user to type in an artist and in return they receive similar artists, a link to the artists' upcoming events, and a link to the artist's homepage. <br>

## Built With 
•HTML <br>
•CSS <br>
•Javascript <br>
•Tastedive API <br>
•Ticketmaster API <br>
•Tailwind CSS library

## Description
The first thing we had to do for this project was decide which server side APIs we wanted to incorporate into our project. We thought that using databases having to do with music would be good because we are all interested in music and concerts. Then we had to write the functions so the results from the TasteDive API, which gives us similar artists to the searched artists, would pass through the Ticketmaster API, which gave us the genre, upcoming events,and links to the webpage. We then had to design the website so the search bar and the results gave us a polished UI that was adaptable to every screen. We also added a localStorage feature so the user could see recent searches.
